# Unity UI Manager

## What is this and why should I use it?
The UI Manager is a stack-based UI controller class. It is designed to make pushing and popping screens in Unity simple and intuitive. No need to have a hundred different UI prefabs sitting in a scene being toggled on and off, the UI Manager can instantiate and manage screens on-demand. It is a cleaner, more streamlined, and easier to maintain approach to UI development than what Unity provides out of the box.
